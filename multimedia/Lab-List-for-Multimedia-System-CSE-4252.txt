    1.  Develop a program to encode and decode a text file with the RLE method. 
        Read the data from a file and write the encoded and decoded data in a separate file.

    2.  Develop a program to encode and decode a text file with the LZW method.
        Assume ASCII code is the initial dictionary for the character of the text file. 
        Read the data from a file and write the encoded and decoded data in a separate file.
        
    3.  Develop a program to encode and decode a string of characters with the arithmetic coding method.  
        Generate the probability of the symbol of the string automatically. 
        Read the data from a file and write the encoded and decoded data in a separate file.

    4.  Develop a program to encode a string of characters with the Huffman coding method.  
        Generate the probability of the symbol of the string automatically. 
        Read the data from a file and encode it 
        (i.e. write the symbol table and the codeword of the data) in another file. 
        Also, decode the encoded data in a separate file.

    5.  Develop a program to apply DCT on a gray level image 16X16 and plot the transformed image. 
        Then apply IDCT on the transformed image and plot it also.
